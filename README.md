# Konsole Theme
This is a Konsole color scheme I've created: if you enjoy it as much as I do,
install it everywhere :P

## Installation instructions
You need (of course) KDE's Konsole  
Caution: this will replace the default color scheme!
```
git clone https://github.com/denysvitali/konsole-theme
cp konsole-theme/Linux.colorscheme ~/.local/share/konsole
```
Restart Konsole and enjoy!
